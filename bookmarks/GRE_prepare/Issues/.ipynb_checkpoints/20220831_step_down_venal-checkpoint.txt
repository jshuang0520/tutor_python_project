論點中心：權力
支持 1. 權利過多 過久 就會貪污腐敗 Holding great power in such a long time can make people tend to corrupt.
e.g. 陳水扁（Chen Shui bian），the former president of Taiwan, had been in power for eight years, from 2000 to 2008. He was accused of being venal, appropriating for more than 2 million New Taiwan dollar per month when he was in office. And the mentioned above is merely one of the court cases he was accused of.
反對 1. 有權力比較容易完成事情 不同人 不同政黨 的政策難以延續
e.g. 核四廠 要蓋 又停工 又恢復 等到快完成又停

The statement claims that in any profession - businness, plitics, education, government - those in power should step down after five years. In my opinion, I agree with this statement, because when mentioning about power or wealth, most of the people are hard to stay rectitude.

There are some vicious impacts to be in power for more than five years. One of the impact is holding great power in such a long time can make people tend to corrupt. For example, Chen Shui Bian, the former president of Taiwan, had been in power for eight years, from 2000 to 2008. He was accused of being venal, appropriating for more than 2 million New Taiwan dollars per month when he was in office. And the mentioned above is merely one of the court cases he was accused of.

However, when the governors make and implement policies, it usually takes a long time to make it effictive. For example, there has been electric shortage issue in Taiwan, especially in the summer time. Some of the experts resorted to building a new nuclear power plant to solve this issue. When KMT (Kuomintang), one of the biggest party in Taiwan, had greater power than DPP (Democratic Progressive Party), another biggest party in Taiwan, in the Legislative Yuan, they implemented this policy 40 years ago, spending billions of dollars to build this nuclear plant. Nonetheless, after the several years, when DPP had greater power than KMT, they stopped this plan due to the safety issue. Until now, because of the transition in power between these two parties which holds different political stances, the nuclear power plant has not yet been completion.

Another reason that I think those in power should step down after five years is because under this time pressure within their term, those in power can do things more efficiently. For example, the NHI (National Health Insurance), a very good health care system in Taiwan, was established and implemented in a relative short time period. Thanks to the efficiency to get this health care system done, now people in Taiwan can be benefit from paying less to go to the hospitals.
