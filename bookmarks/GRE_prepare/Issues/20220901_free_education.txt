論點中心：成本
支持 1. 不支持的好處：不給所有學生可以幫助減輕國家成本
e.g. 只給必要的學生 只有符合 清寒家境的學生，這樣一方面不至於增加過多成本，也能真正幫助到那些沒有資源 卻又有心想要學習的人
反對 1. 支持的壞處：如果提供所有學生免費教育 花費貴 教學品質可能不好
e.g. 學校為了提供所有學生免費課程，面對龐大支出，只好請到收費比較便宜的老師，教學品質沒這麼好．無法把錢花在刀口上，真正提供頂尖的教學內容


(10:51 - 10:56)
論點中心：學習效果
支持 2. 不支持的好處：免費的就不願意認真學習
e.g. 在台灣的大學，常會舉辦一些免費的講座邀請學生來聽，但很多人不珍惜免費資源，不是出現一下就走了，就是睡覺，滑手機，沒有好好吸收講者教學的內容
反對 2.

The statement claims that governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students. Maybe this seems helpful and plausible at the first glance, but in contrast, I personally think governments should offer college and university education free of charge to only some of the students who need this resourse.

One of the vicious impact to provide all students free courses is that the government can face a large deficit. If they only provide this resource to students in need, it can save a lot of money for the nation. For example, if some of the students are born in poor family and they are eager to learn more knowledge, those people can be listed to the group to be subsidized. This can really benefit those who are willing to learn but are unaffordable of the tuition, and the government can save money too.

However, if the government provide free education to all of the students, it will cost a lot of money. And the quality may not be so good. For example, because of running out of money, the schools can only have little money to invite the teachers who charge fewer. So the teaching materials, the contents can be too easy for most of the student. And the schools don't have enough money to provide excellent courses.

Also, if the schools provide free courses, students may not take the course seriously and learn well. For example, for students in Taiwan, we have lots of chances to get free courses at out assembly time. We usually have those free courses on Monday morning, but most of us are unwilling to learn. People just show up a little while, or some of them even skip the class because it is free of charge. It would be a stark contrast to the kindness that the schools want their students to get better education. Thus, schools can only provide free courses to those who are willing to learn more than others, and those who are thankful to get those precious resourses.

To sump up, the mentioned above is why I think governments should offer college and university education free of charge to only some of the students.
