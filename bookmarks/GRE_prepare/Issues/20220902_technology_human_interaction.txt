想點 10:30 - 10:34

論點中心：時間成本
支持 1. 即時性
e.g. apps like fb, ig, line 縮短溝通時間，可以及時和任何人聊天，包括台灣 美國 不受時差影響，也可以及時開會 zoom, google meet
反對 1. 信件 要等很久
e.g. 打仗 寫一封信 報平安 都要等好幾天 溝通不方便


論點中心：新溝通方式
支持 2. 可以更精準表達對方的訊息
e.g. 可以有 emoji，甚至視訊 聽到 看到對方，更可以表達情緒，不會誤會
反對 2. 用原有的溝通方式仍有缺陷 可能會誤會
e.g. 用文字，比較難知道他正在生氣或是開心，有時候難以捉摸就會溝通上產生誤會

As the technology become more convenient, I personally agree that technology provides us with new and better ways to communicate and connect with one another because we can reduce the costs in the communication.

The new technology provides us new ways to communicate with each other, so we can significantly reduce the time cost. For example, whenever we use facebook's messenger, instagram, or line, those apps allow us to chat with our friends immediately. All we have to do is to type words, send our messages, and all the rest is waiting for their reponse. Just in a few seconds, we can enjoy chatting with our friends no matter where we are. Also, because the time cost is significantly reduced, we can even have online meetings immediately. During this COVID-19 pandamic, it is very convenient to communicate with each other so safely and immediately due to the new technology.

However, before these apps are invented, we can only write letters to communicate with each other, which is very time consuming. For example, if a man who was serving in the military in hundreds years ago, the only way he could tell his family that he was safe is to write an envelope, which is very time consuming. The time to wait for the envelope is so long and thus can be suffering.

(10:49 - 10:57)
There is also another benefit that the new technology can provide us. We can not only send text messages but also chat or even see others' faces. It is so nice that we can know more about our friends' mood or what they are going to express. For example, if we chat through instagram, we can open the video mode to not only hear them but also see their face expression. Thus we can know better if they are actually angry or just saying some sarcasm instead. We can reduce the chance to get their message wrong.

(10:57 - 11:00)
Nevertheless, if we don't have these convenient apps to communicate with each other and we are writing envelopes, we don't we emoji to use, and we can't recognize whether he or she is angry or not. So we may wrongly interpret what they mean.

To sum up, the above mentioned is why I personally agree that technology provides us with new and better ways to communicate and connect with one another because we can reduce the costs in the communication.
