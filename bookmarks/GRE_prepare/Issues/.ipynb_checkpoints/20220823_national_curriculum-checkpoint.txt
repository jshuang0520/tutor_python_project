A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.

--

The statement claims a nation should require all of its students to study the same courses util they enter college. In my opinion, I disagree with it because in most cases, this is an unwise policy.

Imagine a situation that a senior student who majors in math, but he has not passed an art course, which is an required major course. So he is probabliy not going to graduate on time. That is rediculous.

In most cases, students in different fields will require different skills. As time goes, they will study more difficult materials in the next several years. For example, students who major in math are required to study Advanced Calculus, a very difficult course that provide a plenty of ways to train one's logic, and that the text book is full of mathematical theorems to prove. Unless a student is determined to train his logic, it is definitely not a good study material for him. Thus, it is implausible to ask every student to study the same courses.

However, in some special cases, it is true that requiring all students to study the same curriculum is beneficial. For example, everyone should have knowledge about health. There is no need to let students in different fields to learn different knowledge about how to wash one's hand clean.

To sum up, I think requiring all students to have the same couses it not plausible.
