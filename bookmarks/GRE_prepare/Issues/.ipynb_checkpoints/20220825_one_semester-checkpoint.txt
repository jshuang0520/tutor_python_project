先想立場：要支持這段話，還是不支持，選一邊站
- if 站到支持那邊
- if 站到不支持那邊


[選一邊站：支持]

- 
論點中心：國際觀
支持 1. 增加國際觀 帶來的好處 e.g. 當地實習 跟外國人合作經驗 未來工作跟外國客戶接觸 溝通順利 合作順利
反對 1. （沒有國際觀）本土 帶來的壞處 e.g. 在國內唸書 國內實習 沒有特別修英文課 未來職涯晉升到經理 有機會跟世界級的經理人開會討論時 比較吃力
------------
10:49 鄭燿炘 我覺得說萬一晉升到一個職位需要國際化時有困難
10:49 鄭燿炘 可能就可以了
10:49 鄭燿炘 會有天花板之類的
------------

論點中心：錢
支持 2. 國外的薪資條件相對優渥，未來更有機會賺更多錢 e.g. 爭取國外實習機會，未來更有可能在外地留下來工作，賺更多薪水
反對 2. （沒有優渥的薪水）meager salary，未來生活水準比較不好 e.g. 台灣是世界上房貸數一數二重的國家，未來生活用國內較低的薪資，同時要背房貸，很多時候就要省吃儉用，珍珠奶茶都不能多買一杯，很痛苦
------------
# ==================================================================
#
# 反對要注意是否舉到錯誤的例子，跟自己選邊站的那個立場不一致的例子
#
# ==================================================================
反對 2. 現在燒錢，很多人家裡經濟情況不好，很負擔 e.g. 吃飯沒有錢配肉了，省吃儉用    e.g. 家裡冷氣壞掉也沒有修理，因為付不起費用
10:39 錢反對那邊
10:39 鄭燿炘 好像整個反了
10:39 鄭燿炘 那邊變成不支持

Studing in a foreign country is a trend in recent years, in my opinion, I agree with the statement that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studing in a foreign country.

There are benifits of studing abroad. One can learn different cultures around the world and gain his 國際觀(international view). For example, if I study abroad for one semester in the United States, it is likely that I will get an intership during that semester. I will get more chances to co-work with foreigners and to enhance my skills to communicate with them. It will be a great experience for me if I have to contact to foreign clients in the future.

However, if we keep staying in our own country, we will have only local experiences, not global ones. This may be a shortcoming in one's resume. For example, for a student in Taiwan, he majored math in National Central University, an university in Taiwan, and he didn't focus on improving his English and commnication skills at all. What's worse, he had no experiences in cooperating with foreigners. Once he gets promoted in his job in the future, and he has to have a meeting with managers from the top 100 companies all around the world, it will be very painful to improve his skills then.

Another benifit for studing in a foreign country is one can make more money in the future to get a better life. Generally speaking, the salary in the United States is more than the salary in Taiwan for the same position. If one can study abroad, it makes him easier to get a job and get more salaries there. For example, if a student study in the United States, he may have a chance to get a job in Google with a competitive 3,000,000 NT dollars as his yearly salary, while if he studies in Taiwan without any international experience, he may get a job in Taiwan with a meager 600,000 NT dollars as his yearly salary. This huge differences in salaries can impact his life in the future. For example, if he has only meager salaries, he will probabliy choose a cheaper restaurant every meal, and is not able to afford another drink even in the hot summer.

To sum up, I agree with the statement that colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studing in a foreign country.
