論點中心：錢 成本
支持 1. 不支持的好處：只給部分學生可以幫助減輕國家成本
e.g. 只給必要的學生 只有符合 清寒家境的學生，這樣一方面不至於增加過多成本，也能真正幫助到那些沒有資源 卻又有心想要學習的人
反對 1. 支持的壞處：國家沒錢去做其他事情
e.g. 學費很貴，國家面臨龐大負擔，可能把錢用在教育上，就沒有足夠錢去做完善的基礎建設，像是交通不方便，卻沒足夠經費再建造新的橋


(10: - 10:21)
論點中心：學習效果
支持 2. 不支持的好處：若作為只提供有限名額的獎勵制度，則可以促進提高學習成效
e.g. 如果政策是，考上班上第一名，就可以免費讀這學期，那會有很多人更認真學習
反對 2. 支持的壞處：大家都可以免費讀，可能就不珍惜每一個學習資源
e.g. 既然免費，翹課也沒關係，上課不認真學也無所謂

The statement claims that governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students. However, I personally agree that governments should offer this free of charge education to only some of the students.

(10:25 - 10:35)
One of the main reason relates to the costs. If governments do not provide this free of charge education to all students, the benefit is, it can save a lot of money for the nation. For example, if the government provides scholar substitutions to those students in need, who are born in poor families, it not only can save money for the nation, but also help those who do not have enough money but want to learn more.

However, if governments provide this free of charge education to all students, the nation can have few budgets to make the social welfare better. For example, if it costs a lot, maybe more than 80 percent of the annual budget of the government, to provide free education, even the residents in a rural town complain that the traffic there is inconvenient and they really need a new highway to get to the downtown, the government can have little money to do so.

Another reason relates to the willingness of learning. The benifit of providing only a limited number of students can enhance their performance. For example, if the schools provide the students who get the first place in their class a full scholarship in that semester, students may study harder to get this bonus.

(10:45 - 10:54)
Neverthless, if all of the students do not have to pay for their tuition, they may not study as hard as before because they may not value all of the available learning resourses. For example, they may think it is okay to skip classes in the morning due to their overslept. Or even they use their phones to play online video games when they attend the calsses. They think it doesn't matter because they don't have to pay for their tuition.

(10:54 - 10:56)
To sum up, the mentioned above are the reasons why I consider governments should offer this free of charge education to only some of the students.
